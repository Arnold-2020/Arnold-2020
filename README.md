Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My Name is Arnold and welcome to my GitHub profile page. I am a Graduate with a Bachelor of Information Sciences. Majoring in Sofware Engineering and also a Minor in Games Programming. 
I did my studies at Massey University from 2020-2022

I am interested in trying new things and gaining new knowledge. I want to get into Front end or Back end programming. I also have a deep passion for Games Programming.


FYI: I am in the process of uploading past projects and making them look presentable for Github. As well I have a few projects in Developemt which is yet to come. Please stay tuned for more.
