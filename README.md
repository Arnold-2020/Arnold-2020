## Hey there, I am Arnold :)

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My Name is Arnold and welcome to my GitHub profile page. 

I am a Graduate with a Bachelor of Information Sciences. Majoring in Software Engineering and also a Minor in Games Programming. 

I did my studies at Massey University from 2020-2022 & had my ceremony in May 2023.

## About Me 
ðŸŒ± I'm currenlty in the process of creating a Unity game based of Space Invaders with colleague

âš¡ My hobbies include, coding, drives, motorbikeriding, hiking, travelling, playing chess, making games & PC building.

ðŸ”­ In the time that I do get free I enjoy learning new skillsets and programming languages

I am interested in trying new things and gaining new knowledge. I want to get into Front end or Back end programming. I also have a deep passion for Games Programming.

FYI: I am in the process of uploading past projects and making them look presentable for Github. As well I have a few projects in Developemt which is yet to come. Please stay tuned for more.

Thank you for visting my Profile page. :)

I also use plastic SCM for Unity Commits as well.
